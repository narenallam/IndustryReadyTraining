When using AWS AppSync with AWS Lambda as a resolver for GraphQL queries, including deeply nested queries, the approach differs from using a library like Graphene directly within Lambda. AppSync handles the GraphQL operations and type definitions, while the Lambda function resolves specific fields or types as designated in the AppSync console. This setup decouples the GraphQL schema definition from the resolution logic, providing flexibility in handling complex and nested queries.

### Initial Setup with a Deeply Nested Query

Suppose you have a GraphQL schema defined in AppSync for a blog application with deeply nested resources like this:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  content: String
  comments: [Comment]
}

type Comment {
  id: ID!
  text: String
  replies: [Reply]
}

type Reply {
  id: ID!
  text: String
}

type Query {
  getPost(id: ID!): Post
}
```

#### Lambda Resolver for `getPost`

Initially, you might have a Lambda function set up to resolve the `getPost` query, which also fetches comments and replies as part of the response. The Lambda function needs to return data matching the expected shape of the `Post` type.

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    post_id = event['arguments']['id']
    
    # Simulated fetch for post, comments, and replies (replace with real data fetch logic)
    post = {
        "id": post_id,
        "title": "Deep Dive into GraphQL",
        "content": "Content of the post...",
        "comments": [
            {
                "id": "1",
                "text": "Great article!",
                "replies": [
                    {"id": "1", "text": "Thank you!"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    
    return post
```

### Changing the Query Structure

Let's say you decide to update your GraphQL schema to include an author for each post and modify how comments are fetched:

```graphql
type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  content: String
  author: Author
  comments: [Comment]
}

# Updated Query to include an author
type Query {
  getPostWithAuthor(id: ID!): Post
}
```

#### Adjusting the Lambda Resolver

After updating the schema in AppSync, you need to modify your Lambda function to resolve the new structure, including fetching the author information for a post. You also adjust the function to match the new query name `getPostWithAuthor` if necessary:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    post_id = event['arguments']['id']
    
    # Simulated fetch for post, author, comments, and replies
    post = {
        "id": post_id,
        "title": "Deep Dive into GraphQL",
        "content": "Content of the post...",
        "author": {
            "id": "author1",
            "name": "Jane Doe"
        },
        "comments": [
            {
                "id": "1",
                "text": "Great article!",
                "replies": [
                    {"id": "1", "text": "Thank you!"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    
    return post
```

### Key Points

- **Schema and Resolvers**: In AppSync, the GraphQL schema and resolvers are managed separately. The schema defines the data structure, while resolvers (which can be Lambda functions) define how to fetch or manipulate the data.
- **Flexibility**: Changing the query structure in AppSync might require updates to the schema and the corresponding resolvers. However, since the resolvers are decoupled from the schema, you can often re-use or minimally adjust existing Lambda functions to accommodate schema changes.
- **Data Fetching**: The Lambda function must return data that matches the structure expected by the schema for the resolved fields. When the schema changes, the functionâ€™s return value might need to be updated accordingly.

This separation allows for greater flexibility and scalability in developing and maintaining your GraphQL API with AWS AppSync and AWS Lambda.
